      <h4>About us</h4>
      <p>ASHRANDA name is inspired from the local Nubian language in southern Egypt, which is an unwritten language
        spoken
        by the people of the Nubia
        region in southern Egypt. The name ASHRANDA means in the Nubian language “the most beautiful girl in the world.”

        Logo is inspired from the shape of the anchor which used in the cruise ships and refers too to the sail and it
        gives too the shape of letter A which is
        the first letter of the name and repeated three times in the beginning, middle and end of the name.
        The color of the logo is Gold which is inspired of Nubia too. Nubia is known in the ancient Egyptian time as
        “The
        Land of Gold”.</p>
